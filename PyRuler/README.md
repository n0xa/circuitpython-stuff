# Adafruit PyRuler

These are projects I am doing with the Adafruit PyRuler.
It's essentially a Trinket M0, with an additional 4 large touch sensors
and single-color LEDs hard-wired, built into a 6x1 inch PCB that is etched
with standard and metric ruler graduations on the front, and a surface mount
PCB reference chart on the back.

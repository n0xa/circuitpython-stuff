# CPX TV-B-Gone Clone
I bought an original TV-B-Gone kit ages ago, and lost it in one of many moves. The resurgence of interest in infrared shenanigans and replay attacks re-kindled my interest in this project in 2022. I also have the DefCon 16 badge with similar functionality, and I referenced the source code for Joe "Kingpin" Grand's methodology of tackling this problem in C for the badge's MC9S08JM60 8-bit microcontroller. I was working on this TV-B-Gone project in parallel with the IR-Replay CircuitPython project to get a feel for really understanding how the various TV remotes work (it's mostly a small subset of operating frequencies that use on-off keying, or OOK). Along the way, I also found a blog post on [DigiKey.com: Circuit Python TV Zapper with Circuit Playground Express](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/circuit-python-tv-zapper-with-circuit-playground-express/643fe3dad81e43518e99ecaede92a856) and the example code there formed the basis of what I've got here. It required a lot of troubleshooting and I made several changes to how it works.

# Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX)

These are projects I am doing with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express.
Sporting a ATSAMD21 ARM Cortex M0 @48 MHz and a dizzying array of sensors,
inputs and outputs, it's basically an all-in-one experimenter's kit. Designed
for CircuitPython, it also supports Microsoft Make:Code and Arduino bootloaders.
